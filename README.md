#Task info: 

Dear Amir,

As agreed, I am sending you the test task.

Theme: Portfolio creation
Description: Create a portfolio about yourself as a ZenDev developer. The portofolio presents your work and needs to incorporate ZenDev logo and branding colors used on ZenDev website. The following segments need to be  included:

Header (it should be sticky and must have ZenDev logo and navigation)
   Navigation must include:
     About me - short intro
     Services  - all your projects listed, each project displayed as a card
     Contact - a separate, new page with a contact form and contact info. When opening a contact page, page reloading must not be triggered
Footer - with social media icons

Notes:
If you do not have (enough of) your work to display, you may use somebody else's projects as a reference.
"About me" and "Services" are not pages. Those are sections on the Homepage that you access when you click on navigation links - anchoring.
Push the test task solution on the public Github repository and send us the link.
Submit the solution by Tuesday, February 22 by noon the latest to this email.
Happy coding! :)
